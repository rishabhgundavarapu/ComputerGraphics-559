Please describe the vehicles you created and how you made them in this file 08-07-01.txt
This is a simple car inspired from crossy road. I have used a boxgeometry for the body and then CylindricalGeometry for the wheels and rims.
I also made windows and a roof using different colors as I couldnt find appropriate textures.
