Explain how you incorporated a material property map here and what its effect is (how can we see it?)
I used a material map consisting of roughness and metalness.I also used a color map of dimaonds on both of the 
spheres.
 The sphere on the left has full roughness and metalness whereas the sphere on the right has full roughness and 0 metalness.
It is very evident that the light only shines and can be visible on the left sphere. Only the metal parts of the sphere (black diamonds) to be exact
shine light. The texture also has certain white spaces grayed with triangles to make this effect seem more apparent.
The sphere on right does not reflect light since it does not have any metalness.
