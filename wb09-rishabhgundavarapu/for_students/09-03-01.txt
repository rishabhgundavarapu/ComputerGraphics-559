Explain how you used a normal and bump map above

From L to R, Bump Map , Combined (Color map+Normal), Normal Map on spheres

The bump map resembles a brick wall but is very poor in doing so. The normal map does a much better job at providing depth to the sphere.
Combining the normal map and a brick wall for the third sphere accurately creates the feeling of a brick wall.
