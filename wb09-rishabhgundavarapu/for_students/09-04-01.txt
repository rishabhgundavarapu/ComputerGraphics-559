Explain where you got your textures and include any attributions here
I was searching for skybox images when I came across this github repo of skybox images https://github.com/thehashton/Three.js-Skybox/tree/master/img
I only used their images since I couldnt find some myself.
Zooming out of the fake skybox will show that its only a cube with textures applied on the side.
On the contrary, the actual skybox cannot be distuingushed like that.
