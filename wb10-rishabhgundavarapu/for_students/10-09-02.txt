Where did the image come from? 

I googled for a simple smiley image. The  link is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley

What lighting did you implement?

I implemented a directional lighting in the z-axis.


Did you do anything beyond basic texure with diffuse lighting (explain)?

I got the yellow value and to make the smiley bump out like the mountains example previously.
